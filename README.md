# Project Overview

Welcome to ASX Stock Viewer!

## Description
This project is an ongoing endeavor where I am gradually building and refining various features. It serves as a dynamic learning platform, allowing me to acquire new coding skills while implementing best practices in software development. The primary focus is not only on functionality but also on optimizing code for efficiency.

## Learning Objectives
- Skill Enhancement: As I navigate through the development process, I am actively working to enhance my proficiency in different coding languages and technologies. Additionally, this is a good opportunity to develop my skills working with APIs and get requests.
- Best Practices: This project serves as a practical playground for experimenting with and adopting industry best practices. I am committed to incorporating clean code principles, design patterns, and other recommended approaches.
- Efficiency Optimisation: One of the key goals is to optimise the code for efficiency. This involves refining algorithms, improving resource utilisation, and embracing performance-centric strategies to ensure a streamlined and responsive application.

## Project Progress
As of now, the project is in its early stages and new features and improvements are continuously being added. The flexibility of this project allows for iterative development, enabling me to apply lessons learned and refine the codebase incrementally.
